Built this dictionary app using clean architecture that gets data from an API and caches it in a local room DB(With caching) so that signle source of truth principle must be followed in this app. I used some animations here like Shimmer load effect etc. Apat from that I sued Room db, Retrofit Api, Dagger hilt D.I.
